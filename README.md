### **What** **is** **The** **Qiskit** **Hackathon** **Barcelona** **about?**

First and foremost, it must be mentioned that The Qiskit Hackathon Barcelona is a 24 hour quantum computing competition featuring live engagement and teamwork by experts from different technological companies. It will take place from 1st and 2nd April in Escola d'Enginyeria UAB.

In this event, those companies will propose us a number of challenges, from which we will have to choose one of them and where our principal concern will be to think about the most effective and fastest solution. 

It has being organized with the collaboration of: Institute of Photonic Sciences (ICFO), IBM Quantum, Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC), Moody's, Qiskit Community, Quantum Barcelona, Institut de Física d'Altes Energies (IFAE), and hosted by Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB).

In other words, the 6 people teams that will take place in this event will have a 24 hour time in order to present their project in front of a jury who will deliberate the winner team.

### **Who** **are** **we?**




We are a group of 6 students studying the Double Degree Program in Physics and Mathematics in the University of Oviedo. Next we will give a brief overview of what we are  going to work in during the next 24 hours and why.

Quantum computing is a rapidly growing field that has the potential to revolutionize the way we process information. It has lots of benefits and new constant challenges. And it is been more and more considered as a powerful tool that will definitely transform the world we live in.

Among the four challenges we were offered. Our final decision has been "Moodys challenge". The main reason why we have chosen this exact challenge has been due to our great interest in quantum computing mixed with the financial modeling, optimization, risk management and fraud detection.

To sum up, we were looking for a challenge where we could find the more theoretical physical part and different financial models joined together. Futhermore we belief in the great potential and impact quantum computing will have in our society and in the financial industry.



### **MOODYS CHALLENGE**

Historically, the creation of derivatives in the late 1970s led to the development of mathematical models to determine their value and reduce the risk of losses. These models have become increasingly sophisticated and require advanced computing power. The use of quantum computing methods can speed up the process of solving option pricing, which is of interest to the industry.

In this challenge, the goal is to create and operate quantum circuits that can simulate the price evolution of an option under certain dynamics (Black Scholes equation) to determine its value. This challenge is suitable for NISQ devices and small-scale quantum simulators, and there is flexibility in how the problem dimension can be represented.

In order to take "Moodys Challenge" we should make clear a number of concepts such as Partial Differential equation and quantum algorithms, The Black Scholes model, Variational quantum imaginary time evolution, The Black-Scholes Hamiltonian for an European call option and its model parameters and basic imports.
