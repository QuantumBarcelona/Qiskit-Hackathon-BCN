We used the QuantumBlur code from the public Github (https://github.com/qiskit-community/QuantumBlur) as the base for our encoding and decoding algorithms.\
To be able to use the code with grayscale images we have adapted the following functions having both modes garyscale or RGB scale\
  &rarr; _image2heights\
  &rarr; blur_image\
  &rarr; height2img
